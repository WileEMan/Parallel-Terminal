TODO: when I try to access a machine using logon credentials that aren't valid for that machine (probably "permission to logon locally" or something) I get a communication error message/timeout instead of an informative, "Your credentials are
no good here." message.

TODO: copy-and-paste would be very nice.

Windows 7 was made to work once I added the TriggerFirewallWarnings() routine to the installation procedure.  
Windows Server 2012 wasn't working, but I suspect the same fix for Windows 7 might work for 2012.
